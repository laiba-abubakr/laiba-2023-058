	<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>James, his sister Sally, and Mark, their BFF (Best Friend Forever) were bored.
    <br> 
    They didn’t know what to do and it was a little too early for them to go home.
    <br> 
    So Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek.” 
    <br>
    Mark turned facing towards the big tree, closed his eyes and started counting out loud.
    <br>
    Sally and James looked at each other,<br>
    and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place.</strong></p>
